## CoreFrontApi is a personal exercise in which I implement how to consume a .NET Core api from a frontend made ASP.NET Core MVC. My backend api has JWT for the authentication of the requests made from CoreFrontApi. To access the handler and be able to make CRUD requests just enter the credentials that are in my GitHub repository.

## The *BackApi_JWT* project is hosted at <https://somee.com>

## To access the api we type the address <http://corebackapi.somee.com/CoreApiBackend/Swagger/Index.html> for JWT authorization the credentials are user: *test@gmail.com* password: *123*
